	* Makefile.am: use BUILT_SOURCES to ensure bison/flex generated
	  sources are built first (and distributed and only deleted on
	  make maintainer-clean)


2022-02-02  Simon Sobisch <simonsobisch@gnu.org>

	* ocdblog.h, ocdblog.c, odbcutil.c, odbcutil.h:
	  changed magic numbers to enum ocloglevel, 
	  use a single static loglevel instead of one for each source
	* ocesql.c (OCESQLEndSQL, add_prepare_list): only run debug logging
	  code if debug logging is active
	* ocesql.c (create_coboldata) [!NDEBUG]: send data to logging
	  without unnecessary temporary string duplication 
	* ocdblog.h: changed definitions for LOG and ERRLOG to only call the
	  logging functions if the current loglevel is either unknown or
	  set to actually do that logging which saves a lot of stack changes
	  (nice for 'step'ing with the debugger and for saving cpu cycles if
	  logging is disabled)
	* ocdbutil.c (com_get_logfile): simplified
	* ocdbutil.c (env_to_loglevel): extracted from com_get_loglevel,
	  changed default from "no log" to "log only errors"
	* ocdbutil.c (com_get_logfile) [_WIN32]: changed default log path
	  to current working directory instead of D:\develop
	* ocdbutil.c (com_sleep, com_strdup): inlined calculation

	* Makefile.am: added EXTRA_DIST to ship headers, necessary for make dist
